[![:the_jam:](https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/745354525958996138.gif?v=1)](https://asyrafff.com/)

I'm most comfortable with `Python`, `Excel` & `SQL` for **Data Science** and **Data Analysis**.

I make **music** in my free time and am actually a bedroom Music Producer. Being a maniacal fan of Kevin Parker for so long :P
